## 1. Solution Overview

The AI Lead Scoring Dashboard is a comprehensive web application that combines Machine Learning with LLM-inspired reranking to predict lead intent and prioritize high-value prospects. The system addresses the core problem of brokers wasting time on low-intent leads by delivering an "Intent Score" (0-100) to prioritize high-intent prospects.

### Key Features:
- **Machine Learning Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier with 82.98% accuracy
- **LLM Reranker**: Rule-based system analyzing comments for intent keywords
- **Real-time API**: FastAPI backend with <300ms response time
- **Interactive Dashboard**: React frontend with form, table, and charts
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage for leads and browser persistence

### Architecture:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with scikit-learn ML model
- **Frontend**: React with custom CSS utilities
- **Dataset**: Bank Marketing Dataset (11,163 records)
- **Deployment**: Render (backend) + Netlify (frontend)

## 2. Architecture

### Backend Architecture:
```
FastAPI Application
├── ML Model Loading (joblib)
├── LLM Reranker (rule-based)
├── Input Validation (Pydantic)
├── CORS Middleware
└── API Endpoints (/score, /leads, /health)
```

### Frontend Architecture:
```
React Application
├── LeadForm Component (validation, submission)
├── LeadTable Component (sorting, display)
├── ScoreChart Component (statistics, visualization)
├── Header Component (branding)
└── Local Storage (data persistence)
```

### Data Flow:
1. User fills lead form with customer data
2. Frontend validates input and sends to backend
3. Backend processes with ML model for initial score
4. LLM reranker analyzes comments for score adjustment
5. Response includes both initial and reranked scores
6. Frontend displays results in table and charts

## 3. ML Model

### Model Choice: Gradient Boosting Classifier
**Justification**: 
- Excellent performance on structured data
- Handles both numerical and categorical features
- Provides feature importance insights
- Robust against overfitting
- Fast inference time for real-time scoring

### Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset
- **Size**: 11,163 records
- **Features**: 14 relevant features (age, job, marital, education, etc.)
- **Target**: Deposit (yes/no) - converted to lead intent
- **Quality**: Real-world data with meaningful patterns

### Feature Engineering:
- **Categorical Encoding**: Label encoding for job, marital, education, etc.
- **Feature Selection**: 14 most relevant features for lead scoring
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and outliers

### Model Performance:
- **Accuracy**: 82.98%
- **Precision**: 0.81 (high-intent class)
- **Recall**: 0.84 (high-intent class)
- **F1-Score**: 0.82

### Feature Importance:
1. Duration (51.4%) - Contact duration in seconds
2. Contact (9.0%) - Contact communication type
3. Pdays (8.7%) - Days since last contact
4. Age (6.4%) - Customer age
5. Balance (5.7%) - Average yearly balance

## 4. LLM Reranker

### Implementation: Rule-based Keyword Analysis
**Approach**: Simulates LLM behavior by analyzing comments for intent indicators

### Positive Keywords (+5 to +15 points):
- "urgent" (+15), "interested" (+10), "ready" (+10)
- "immediately" (+12), "asap" (+15), "need" (+8)
- "investment" (+8), "financial" (+5), "buy" (+10)
- "apply" (+10), "sign" (+10), "proceed" (+10)

### Negative Keywords (-5 to -20 points):
- "not interested" (-20), "no interest" (-15)
- "expensive" (-8), "costly" (-8), "cannot afford" (-15)
- "worried" (-8), "concerned" (-5), "risk" (-5)
- "never" (-15), "no way" (-15), "unsubscribe" (-15)

### Sentiment Analysis:
- **Exclamation marks**: +2 points each
- **Question marks**: -1 point each
- **Score capping**: 0-100 range enforcement

### Example Adjustments:
- Comment: "I'm very interested in this investment opportunity!"
- Adjustment: +10 (interested) + 2 (exclamation) = +12 points
- Comment: "This seems too expensive for me"
- Adjustment: -8 (expensive) = -8 points

## 5. Compliance

### DPDP-Ready Implementation:
- **Consent Management**: Mandatory checkbox for data processing
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary fields for scoring
- **Local Storage**: No server-side PII storage
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive field validation
- **Dummy Data**: No real PII collection in demo

### Compliance Measures:
1. **Explicit Consent**: Required checkbox before form submission
2. **Data Purpose**: Clear explanation of lead scoring purpose
3. **Data Retention**: Local storage only, user controls
4. **Data Security**: Client-side processing, no server storage
5. **Transparency**: Clear scoring methodology and factors

### Implementation Details:
- Form validation ensures consent is provided
- All data processing happens locally in browser
- No persistent server-side storage of PII
- Clear privacy policy and data usage explanation
